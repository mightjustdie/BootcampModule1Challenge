This is a challenge where an existing website, with errors, was given to fix and submit.
The errors I found upon looking at the webpage are listed here:
-Line 7 for the title did not have a descriptive title
-Lines 27,30,37,44,54,61,& 68 were edited for the images to have an "alt" tag
-Line 30 was edited to add the "id" so the text, when clicked, take you to the description of said text
