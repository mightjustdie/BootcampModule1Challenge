This is a challenge where an existing website, with errors, was given to fix and submit.
The errors I found upon looking at the webpage are listed here:
-Line 7 for the title did not have a descriptive title
-Lines 27,30,37,44,54,61,& 68 did not have an "alt" tag for the images
-Line 30 did not have an ID tag making the text not function as the others do in the header
These errors were corrected
